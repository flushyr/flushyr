## Hi ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub.
My name is Roger Zhu, and I currently study at the University of Queensland. 
I am in Advanced Science (Hons) majoring in Computer Science, Statistics, with a minor in Data Science.

Ever since I picked up coding, I have used it to automate repetitive parts of my life. I will post any interesting applicaitons I build and school projects I am proud of on my page.
